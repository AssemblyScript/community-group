# Topics

Please note that the Community Group is farily new, so the following list is not exclusive. At this point in time, the majority of projects are platforms/runtimes that allow other third-party developers to develop, deploy, and execute modules written in AssemblyScript. This includes both trustful and trustless platforms.

* AssemblyScript DevX -- discussing missing language features and they way to implement them. Also we discuss the various approaches to interfacing AssemblyScript modules with the platform, e.g. do we choose eDSL or meta-programming approach;
* AssemblyScript libraries -- since we cannot import TypeScript libraries, common libraries like serialization, math, etc need to be reimplemented;
* AssemblyScript compiler hooks -- unlike Rust AssemblyScript does not have macros that would allow implementing basic code transformations that are important for eDSL or meta-programming. Many of these hooks are pretty common to most projects.
