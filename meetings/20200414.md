## Proposed Agenda
* Introduction of the attendees;
* Discussion of the goals of this CG;
* Sharing use cases and pain points;
* Discussing and prioritizing the language and devtools features, see below;
* Discussing and prioritizing AssemblyScript libraries

### Language and devtools features
Kudos to @bowenwang1996 for coming up with the original list.

* Interfaces and virtual functions 
  * Status: In progress
  * Work Items:
    * Define the features of interface/virtual functions that should be supported
    * Figure out the best way to implement virtual functions
    * Related issue: https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/issues/693
    * Relate PR: https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/pull/862
  * Who’s working on it: @willemneal, @dcodeIO, @MaxGraey
* Closure
  * Status: To do
  * Work Items:
    * Figure out the best way to implement closures (seems like we agreed on using anonymous class)
  * Who’s working on it: @DuncanUszkay1
* Iterators
  * Status: Have an old example, but will improve once interfaces are supported.
  * Work Items:
    * Implement iterators that follow the same pattern as typescript
  * Who’s working on it: @willemneal
* Linting
  * Currently rely on typescript linters/compiler errors in IDEs
  * Work Items:
    * Implement 
* Ad-hoc polymorphism
  * Status: To do
  * Work Items:
    * Figure out how to overload constructors and methods on the same name
  * Who’s working on it: No one
* Stabilization
  * Status: In progress
  * Work Items:
    * Stabilize type resolution
    * Make sure there is no unexpected compiler errors
    * Make sure that the standard library works well (for example it should resemble typescript closely)
  * Who’s working on it: @dcodeIO, @MaxGraey
* Miscellaneous (these are of lower priorities in my opinion)
  * Status: To do
  * Work Items:
    * Implement Date that is similar to typescript
    * Stack trace support
    * Regex support
  * Who’s working on it: No one

### AssemblyScript Libraries

* [as-pect](https://github.com/jtenner/as-pect) -- testing library;
* [JSON encoder/decoder](https://github.com/nearprotocol/assemblyscript-json);
* [BSON encoder/decoder](https://github.com/nearprotocol/assemblyscript-bson);
* [RLP encoder/decoder](https://github.com/nearprotocol/assemblyscript-rlp).
